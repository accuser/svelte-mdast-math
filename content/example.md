Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

## Headers

Headers are prefixed with a hash symbol (`#`). The number of hash symbols indicates the level of the header. For example, one hash symbol (`#`) indicates a level one header, two hash symbols (`##`) indicate a level two header, and so on.

## Emphasis

Text can be italicized by wrapping it in asterisks or underscores. For example, `*italicized text*` and `_italicized text_` both render as italicized text. Text can be bolded by wrapping it in two asterisks or underscores. For example, `**bolded text**` and `__bolded text__` both render as bolded text.

## Lists

Unordered lists are created by prefixing list items with an asterisk, plus sign, or hyphen. For example:

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

Ordered lists are created by prefixing list items with a number followed by a period. For example:

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

## Links

Links are created by wrapping the link text in square brackets followed by the URL in parentheses. For example, `[example link](http://www.example.com)` renders as [example link](http://www.example.com).
